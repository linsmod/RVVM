 * GENERATED FILE - produced by tools/gen_gl_abi.py - DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.
 *
 * Source of truth: NDK sysroot headers GLES2/gl2.h + EGL/egl.h (parsed).
 * Regenerate with:  python tools/gen_gl_abi.py
 *
 * Phase 3 ABI notes:
 *  - fn_id macros are the single source of truth shared by the guest stubs,
 *    src/virtpass/vp_cmdpost.c and the win32 host GL dispatch.
 *  - gl_call.args has 9 slots (glCompressedTexSubImage2D needs 9; the
 *    original Phase 3 plan said 6 - widened before first deployment, so this
 *    is an internal ABI change with zero consumers).
 *  - Floats travel bit-packed through the int64_t slots; pointers travel as
 *    guest virtual addresses. Guest memory is NOT mapped into the host, so
 *    the host dispatch translates every data pointer argument with
 *    rvvm_user_guest_ptr() and, for calls that hand back a host-owned string
 *    (glGetString/eglQueryString), copies it through the guest scratch
 *    buffer offered in args[GL_CALL_RETBUF_SLOT].

/* ---- backend lifecycle -------------------------------------------- */

/*
 * Load libEGL.dll + libGLESv2.dll and resolve all entry points.
 * Idempotent and lazily cached: first call does the work, later calls are
 * no-ops returning the cached result. Selection:
 *
 *   RVVM_GL_BACKEND   = angle | swiftshader | off   (default: angle,
 *                     falling back to swiftshader if angle fails)
 *   RVVM_GL_DLL_DIR   = explicit directory containing libEGL.dll and
 *                     libGLESv2.dll (skips backend lookup)
 *
 * Without RVVM_GL_DLL_DIR the Android SDK emulator tree is searched:
 *   <sdk>/emulator/lib64/gles_angle, gles_swiftshader, gles_angle9, ...
 * with <sdk> taken from ANDROID_SDK_ROOT / ANDROID_HOME, then the per-user
 * install under LOCALAPPDATA/Android/Sdk or USERPROFILE/AppData/Local.
 *
 * When no backend can be loaded every GL/EGL dispatch returns 0, which
 * makes guests fall back to the CPU rendering path (WINDOW_LOCK/UNLOCK).
